<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>For this project, I implemented rasterization of triangles, antialiasing of triangles via supersampling, the translation, scaling, and rotation matrices, barycentric coordinates and interpolation via barycentric coordinates, pixel sampling for texture mapping, and level sampling with mipmaps for texture mapping. Together these functions, with the help of the starter code, can create very accurate pixel representations of various colored polygons and other images at various magnifications, with options that can reduce aliasing in either case. The most difficult part of the project was making sure all pixel samples were within the range of the viewing window and texture file, which I only noticed after finishing the rest of the project. I know now not to ignore segmentation faults early in the project and to deal with them before they propogate.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>To rasterize triangles, I first determine the bounding box of the triangle by finding the pixels containing the vertices with the highest and lowest x and y values. This way, I only check at most each sample within the bounding box of the triangle, with some samples potentially cut off if they are outside the screen. Then, I determine if the vertices are given in counterclockwise or clockwise order by finding the centroid of the triangle, which must by definition be inside the triangle, and the equation of a single edge and seeing if the centroid is above the edge, meaning the vertices are counterclockwise, or below the edge, meaning the vertices are clockwise. Then, I find the center of each pixel and check if it is above every edge of the triangle, if the vertices are given counterclockwise, or if it below every edge of the triangle, if the vertices are given clockwise, or if it is on a left or top edge. If one of these conditions holds, I consider the pixel inside the triangle and color it appropriately.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

<p>I implemented supersampling by iterating through different points in each pixel in addition to iterating through the pixels as in Part 1. Given the sample rate, I found the center of each subpixel by adding the coordinates of the top left corner of the whole pixel to one over the sample rate times the subpixel we are working on, plus one half of one over the sampling rate. Now, I perform the same triangle containment test as in Part 1, but for each subpixel instead of the entire pixel at once. When I eventually write the pixel to the screen, I average the colors of each subpixel and treat that as the pixel's overall color. This antialiases the triangles by smoothing out the edges, since pixels near the edge of the triangle will take intermediate values as a result of some subpixels being in the triangle and some subpixels being outside the triangle. This filters out extreme frequencies by creating a smoother transition between different colors.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

<p>Barycentric coordinates are a way to describe the position of a point with respect to the vertices of a triangle. One method for finding barycentric coordinates, which I used in this project, is to find the ratio of a side evaluated at the point and the side evaluated at the opposite vertex. A more useful definition might be that the barycentric coordinate corresponding to a vertex is the ratio of the area of the triangle formed with the new point replacing that vertex to the area of the entire triangle. This definition of barycentric coordinates allows us to interpolate other values pertaining to points inside the triangle, such as color. For example, if we have vertices that are purely red, blue, and green, we expect points closer to the red vertex to be more red, and points near the center to have roughly equal values of each color, since replacing any vertex with the center point will yield roughly the same triangle.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

<p>Pixel sampling is how we select the color for a pixel on the screen based on the pixel's relative position in the texture map. Wse first find the barycentric coordinates of the pixel in the image space, and then interpolate based on the vertices' (u, v) coordinates in the texture to find the coordinates of the corresponding position in the texture space. For nearest sampling, I return the color of the texel that I mapped into. In bilinear sampling, I find the nearest four texels and use linear interpolation from their centers to find two lines which I also interpolate to find the color to use for the original pixel. I also make sure to limit the (u, v) coordinates to be within the texture map.</p>

<p>Increasing the supersampling rate or switching to bilinear sampling both antialias the image, most obviously causing the latitude and longitude lines on the globe to become smoother and more continuous. Supersampling with 16 subpixels is more successful than pure bilinear sampling, though combining the two smooths out the finer details near the edge of the image. There will be a large difference between nearest and bilinear sampling as we magnify the image, or if there are many pixels closer to the viewer. In these cases, a single texel will be mapped to by many pixels, so that nearby pixels will interpolate between the same texels and lead to a smooth transition of colors. In contrast, if a pixel covers many texels, different pixel samples will sample map to different texels and there will not be a smooth transition.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

<p>In order to antialias textures at different depths, we want to create different resolutions of the texture called mipmaps and match the sample rates of the texture and the image, so that one pixel in the image corresponds roughly to one pixel of the chosen mipmap. This will prevent aliasing by maintaining a smooth transition in the texture, rather than having pixels map to distant texels. To find the appropriate mipmap level for a given pixel, I find the (u, v) coordinates of the pixel and the pixels immediately above and to the right. I then find the distance from the first texel to its surrounding texels in the texture space using basic trigonemtry, and take the second log of the largest distance as the level. So, if the neighboring texel is 1 away, there is a rough 1-to-1 correspondence between pixels and texels and I would use level 0. I have to limit the level to be between 0 and 8, inclusive, since level 0 is the original texture and we cannot have negative levels at higher resolution than the original texture, and level 8 consists of a single pixel, so further levels cannot have a lower resolution. For trilinear sampling, I perform a bilinear sample at both the ceiling and floor of the level, and then linearly interpolate the colors I get from each level.</p>

<p>As expected, there are tradeoffs between image quality in the form of antialiasing and speed and memory usage. Increasing the number of samples per pixel decreases aliasing, but more samples will take more time and require more memory to store the sub-pixel colors. The antialiasing affect is the same at different levels of magnification, but increasing the number of pixels on the screen drastically increases the time and memory needed to check all pixels and subpixels. Doing bilinear pixel sampling increases time, since we need to do several more calculations for each pixel, but does not significantly increase memory, since we don't store the values of the surrounding texels after finding them. Bilinear pixel sampling only significantly antialiases the image when zoomed in, and has little affect on the zoomed out image. Nearest level requires time to calculate the new level and takes up at most 4/3 of the memory of the original texture map, but it only really affects the zoomed out view. Trilinear filtering requires doing bilinear calculations at two levels and thus takes significantly more time, but itrequires no new memory and antialiases much more effectively, since it creates a smooth transition between texture resolutions.</p>
